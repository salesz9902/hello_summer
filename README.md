# :sun_with_face: Hello Summer! :sun_with_face:
I decided to brush up all of the programming tasks we have learned in the 1st and 2nd semesters.
I am doing this because I feel like I did not get my part enough out of it.

So in this repository you can see all of the occurring tasks during my first 2 semesters.

# 1st semester
The first semester was based on the book **Bjarne Stroustrup: Programming: Principles and Practice using C++ (2nd edition)**

The main thing is to just finish all the drills and understand what those exactly do. Compile as much tasks in it as possible, and discuss it with the other students.

We also got some extra tasks every week:
## 1st week
  * Swapping variable value by exor
  * Swapping variable value by difference
  * Swapping variable value by multiplication
  * Bitshift operator
## 2nd week
  * Bouncing ball in C
  * Bouncing ball without if statement in C++
## 3rd week
  * PageRank in C
## 4th week
  * PageRank by vector
  * PageRank by iterator
## 5th week
  * Exor decrypting - e.c
  * Exor decrypting - t.c modify
## 6th week
  * LZW Binary tree in C++
## 7th week
  * LZW Binary tree - exception handling
## 8th week
  * LZW Binary tree - move constructor
  * LZW Binary tree - copy constructor
## 9th week
  * LZW Binary tree - operator

You can browse all of them in the **Bjarne_Stroustrup/extra_tasks** folder.
