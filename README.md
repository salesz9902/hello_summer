# :sun_with_face: Hello Summer! :sun_with_face:
I decided to brush up all of the programming tasks we have learned in the 1st and 2nd semester.
I am doing this because I feel like I did not get my part enough out of it.

So in this repository you can see all of the occurring tasks during my first 2 semester.

The first book is **Bjarne Stroustrup: Programming: Principles and Practice using C++ (2nd edition)**
